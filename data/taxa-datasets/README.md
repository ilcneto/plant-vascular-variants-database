# Taxon-Level Datasets of Vascular Variants Across Seed Plants									
This directory contains taxon-specific datasets documenting the occurrence, diversity, and classification of vascular variants across plant orders and families.
All datasets are structured using the vascular variants framework and are conceptually linked to the **Global Survey of Vascular Variants Across Seed Plants**.
Each taxon-level dataset represents a modular contribution to the Plant Vascular Variants Database and may differ in taxonomic scope, anatomical resolution, and variant coverage.

## Current datasets
- Fabaceae (Ectopic cambia, vascular variants)
	This includes a survey on the distribution of ectopic cambia (vascular variants). 

## Forthcoming datasets
- Caryophyllales
	Medullary Bundles (vascular variants)
	(based on Cunha-Neto et al., 2024)
- Nyctaginaceae
	Vascular variants
	(based on Cunha-Neto et al., 2022)
- Sapindaceae
	Vascular variants
	(based on Cunha-Neto et al., preprint)
	
Additional taxon-level datasets will be added as new studies are completed and published.
