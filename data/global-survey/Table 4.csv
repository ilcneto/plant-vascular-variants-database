Term,Synonyms,Definition
Cable structure,NA,"Stems with multiple vascular cylinders, such as compound or divided stem."
Continuous procambium,Continuous concentric procambium,"Used in the context of species with medullary bundles, it refers to procambial ring that originates vascular bundles delimiting the pith, from where secondary growth may initiate. See Cunha Neto et al., 2022, 2024 for further details. "
Corded stem,Corded vascular cylinder; corded xylem mass,A type of ectopic cambia which forms usually 5-7 developmentally asynchronous peripheral vascular cylinders; the rise of the peripheral vascular cylinders make the stem non-cylindrical; typical of Thinouia (Sapindaceae).
Differential cambial activity ,NA,Atypical cambial activity producing vascular tissues at unusual and/or heterogenous rates.
Extra-fascicular cambium,NA,"Cambium formed independent of the vascular bundles of the eustele; the typical cambium (from stele bundles) is not formed in these species. See Cunha Neto et al., 2024 for further details. "
Lobed stem,NA,Stem characterized by lobes and furrows; a type of non-cylindrical stems.
Medullary vascular tissue,Medullary vascular system,"Conducting vascular tissue in the pith; comprises tissues derived from disparate developmental processes (e.g., intraxylary phloem, medullary bundles); term applied for both living and fossil plants. See Cunha Neto et al., 2024 for further details. "
Neoformations,Neo-formed vascular tissue; neo-formed peripheral vascular strand,A type of ectopic cambia that creates vascular units embedded in the existing vascular tissue; the rise of the vascular units do not change stem outline. 
Perimedullary phloem,NA,"Phloem located near the pith, usually derived from intraxylary phloem. "
Peripheral vascular cylinder,NA,"Vascular cylinders produced in addition to the regular cylinder; mostly known from the corded, divided and compound stems."
Primary Thickening Meristem,Procambium,"Vascular meristem occurring in the shoots of monocots generating the atactostele, a pattern of procambial variant"
Procambium,NA,Vascular meristem that generates primary vascular tissues; precursor of the vascular cambium.
Secondary growth,NA,"The production of vascular tissues by a secondary vascular meristem (e.g., cambium, monocot cambium)."
Secondary Thickening Meristem,Monocot cambium,"Vascular meristem that divide bidirectionally, adding secondary vascular bundles, and parenchyma to both the cortex and the central cylinder."
Successive cambia,Supernumerary cambia; accessory cambia,"A type of ectopic cambia in which new cambia are usually concentric; each new cambia and its products form successively and may be concentric or semi-concentric, in which case they may form flattened or non-cylindrical stems/roots."
Tertiary growth,NA,"In the context of vascular variants, may denote vascular tissues derived from a ""tertiary meristem"", which can be defined as a vascular meristem originated from parenchymatic tissues (i.e., ectopic cambia). The term is also applied to describe the development of storage organs which, however, include both vascular and non-vascular processes.  "
Typical cambium,Cylindrical vascular cambium; regular cambium,Bifacial vascular cambium originated from the eustele.
Typical growth,NA,"The typical development of seed plants formed by an eustele + a bifacial single cambium, and putative ancestor of seed plants. The typical secondary growth produces secondary xylem inwards and secondary phloem outwards at homogeneous rates, thus creating a single, solid vasculary cylinder."
Typical secondary growth,Regular growth,A bifacial cambium produces secondary xylem inwards and secondary phloem outwards at homogeneous rates; this process generates a single vascular cylinder; the putative mode of secondary growth in the ancestor of the lignophytes
Variant cambium,Atypical cambium,Any cambium other than the typical cambium derived from the eustele.
Variant phloem,NA,Secondary phloem produced by any variant cambium.
Variant xylem,NA,Secondary xylem produced by any variant cambium.
Vascular cambium,NA,"Lateral meristem formed by axial and radial initials, which divide continuously producing derivatives that differentiate into secondary xylem and secondary phloem."
Vascular cylinder,NA,"Cylinder of xylem and phloem in the axis derived from procambium + cambium development; this definition differs from Evert (2006), which restricts the term to the stele. "
Vascular fascicle,NA,"Vascular bundles after secondary growth; it occurs, for instance, on isolated bundles in polycyclic eusteles. "
