# Global Survey of Vascular Variants Across Seed Plants											
This dataset provides a curated, framework-level survey of vascular variants across seed plants. It compiles standardized terminology, structural categories, and patterns, and their phylogenetic distribution at the family level.
The global survey constitutes the foundational dataset of the Plant Vascular Variants Database.

## Dataset structure											
- ### Vascular Variant Category 	
	Indicates the names of the categories, which are based on major developmental pathways linked to modifications at different developmental stages, namely at the procambial, cambial, and ectopic cambia levels. Each category includes multiple patterns.  										

- ### Category definition
	Defines what the category is in a developmental perspective. 											

- ### Vascular Variant Pattern 	
	Indicates the names of the patterns, which describe major macro-morphologies derived from specific developmental changes.  										
- ### Pattern definition
	Defines what the pattern is and its alternative names. 
	
- ### Functional Category
	Translate the vascular variant patterns into three major functional categories for ecological and functional studies. This classification is adapted from Kacamak et al. (2025).
  	- #### Uniform (wood)
    Secondary xylem is undivided (except for rays), and the circumference is cylindrical or non-cylindrical.  
	- #### Non-uniform (wood)
    Secondary xylem is still the main component of the wood cylinder, but it possesses small amounts of soft tissue derived from the differential activity of a single cambium. 
	- #### Compound (wood)
    Secondary xylem is divided into independent cylinders, either fragments of one vascular cylinder or multiple vascular cylinders. Phloem and parenchyma (soft tissues) separate compartments of the secondary xylem.
	
- ### Synonyms
	Indicate alternative names used for the vascular variant pattern. 
										
- ### Notes
	Include additional comments related to pattern definition and case studies.	
		
The database also includes a "References" list.
