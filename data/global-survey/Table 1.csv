Vascular variant category ,Category definition,Vascular variant pattern ,Pattern definition,Functional category,Synonyms,Notes ,,,,,
Procambial variant,"Atyical procambial patterning creates unusual vascular organization during primary growth; in seed plants, they represent deviations from the typical eustele; they may or may not be directly implicated with atypical secondary growth (cambial variants). ",Atactostele,A stele formed by vascular bundles scattered in the stem as seen in cross section. ,Uniform,Monocot cyclostele.,Typical of monocots.  ,,,,,
,,Bicollateral bundles,Vascular bundles with phloem on both sides of the primary xylem. ,Uniform,NA,NA,,,,,
,,Compound stem,Stem formed by a central vascular cylinder surrounded by multiple peripheral vascular cylinders derived from unusual procambial patterning. ,Compound,"Compound vascular cylinder, compound xylem mass.",Exclusive of Sapindaceae. ,,,,,
,,Divided stem,"Stems with 5-7 peripheral vascular cylinders, and without a central cylinder.",Compound,"Divided vascular cylinder, divided xylem mass. ",Exclusive of Sapindaceae.,,,,,
,,External vascular cylinders,Vascular cylinders derived from isolated medullary bundles that undergo secondary growth.,Uniform,NA,"This term was assigned exclusively to Piperaceae (see Cunha-Neto 2023). A similar process may be observed in species with compound stems, where isolated vascular bundles can differentiate into isolated vascular cylinders (see Marques et al., 2025).",,,,,
,,Intraxylary phloem,Phloem differentiates internally to the primary xylem; the new phloem may be associated with a de novo cambium (see Ectopic cambia). ,Uniform,NA,NA,,,,,
,,Medullary bundles,Vascular bundles scattered in the pith derived from vascular leaf/bud traces in non-monocots. ,Uniform,Polycyclic eustele.,See Cunha-Neto et al. (2024) for further information on developmental diversity within this pattern.,,,,,
,,Siphonostele,A stele consituted of a pith surrounded by a continuous procambial forming xylem and phloem along its entire circunference. ,Uniform,NA,NA,,,,,
Cambial variant,"Atypical cambial activity generates vascular tissues with unusual arrangements, which may or may not result in non-cylindrical stems/roots; in seed plants, they are deviations from the single bifacial cambium, which produce homogenous amounts of secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem (inner bark). ",Axial vascular elements in segments,Stems in which large rays separate secondary xylem and phloem in seemingly equal segments. ,Uniform,"Axial elements in plates, axial vascular elements in radial segments.",NA,,,,,
,,Fissured stem,Dissected vascular cylinder due to the formation of phloem wedges and parenchyma proliferation that compartmentalizes the secondary xylem. ,Compound,"Fissured vascular cylinder, dispersed xylem, cleft xylem mass, and cleaved xylem.",NA,,,,,
,,Interxylary phloem,Strands of secondary phloem (phloem islands) are embedded within the secondary xylem. ,Non-uniform,Included phloem.,See Angyalossy et al. (2016) for further information on developmental diversity within this pattern.,,,,,
,,Non-cylindrical stem,Stems that become non-cicular at maturity. ,Uniform,Asymetrical stems.,"Includes cases such as lobed, flattened, and rectangular stems. See Luna-Márquez et al. (2021) for a case study in Malvaceae. ",,,,,
,,Phloem wedges,Increased production of phloem in some sectors of the cambium generates phloem arcs or wedges in the secondary xylem (wood). ,Non-uniform,Xylem furrowed by phloem wedges. ,"See Pace et al. (2009), Quintanar-Castillo and Pace (2022), and Cunha-Neto et al. (2023) for case studies and further details on developmental diversity within this pattern.",,,,,
,,Raylessness,Stem or roots without vascular rays.,Uniform,NA,See Frankiewicz and Oskolski 2023 for further information on developmental diversity related to this pattern. ,,,,,
Ectopic cambia,"The formation of one or multiple cambia in unusual locations in addition to the original vascular cambium; this process starts after some period of regular secondary growth, and may or may not generate non-cylindrical stems/roots.",Ectopic cambia,"Denotes the production of one or more cambia arising in an unsual location (e.g., cortex or phloem), in addition to the original vascular cambium.",Compound,NA,"Includes other morphotypes such as ""successive cambia"", ""neoformations"", and ""corded stem; also called ""accessory cambia"", ""de novo cambium"", ""neo-formed cambium"", or ""neocambium"". See Cunha Neto and Onyenedum 2023 for further information of developmental diversity within this pattern. This pattern also includes ""interxylary cambia"" (Pace et al., 2018), which creates new cambia from wood axial parenchyma, and ""intraxylary cambia"", derived from pith parenchyma (Rajput et al., 2022; Thacker et al., 2026).",,,,,

,,Monocot cambium,Creates additional vascular bundles inward and parenchyma outward.  ,Compound,Secondary thickening meristem.,Exclusive of monocots. ,,,,,
