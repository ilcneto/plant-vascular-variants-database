# Plant Vascular Variants Database
A curated, living database documenting the diversity, classification, and phylogenetic distribution of vascular variants across seed plants. The database operationalizes the vascular variants framework introduced in Cunha-Neto et al. (2023) and is continuously updated as new data and studies become available.

## Background
Most seed plants exhibit a conserved pattern of vascular organization (“typical growth”). In contrast, many lineages exhibit alternative vascular tissue arrangements, collectively termed vascular variants. The vascular variants framework provides a standardized terminology and classification to describe these alternative developmental architectures and to facilitate comparative, evolutionary, and functional studies across plant lineages.							

## Database Structure
The Plant Vascular Variants Database is organized into two complementary components:

### 1. Core Framework & Global Survey (located in /data/globalsurvey)
This component represents the global survey underlying the original framework and novel parts (e.g., functional categories). 
This dataset includes:
	- Definitions of vascular variant categories and patterns.
	- Phylogenetic distribution of vascular variants across seed plant families
	- Historical terminology used to describe vascular variants.
	- A glossary of terms associated with vascular variants. 

### 2. Modular Family-Level Datasets (located in /data/order_family_datasets)
This component comprises high-resolution datasets focused on specific orders or families and associated with peer-reviewed publications. This dataset includes species-level coding and expanded anatomical or functional information. Each module includes a README that provides detailed scope and citation instructions.
										
## Governance of the Plant Vascular Variants Database
The Plant Vascular Variants Database is a curated, living scientific resource maintained by Israel L. Cunha-Neto and collaborators.

### 1. Update Policy
	- Core framework updates occur when new evidence refines terminology, classification, or distribution.
	- Modular datasets are updated in coordination with associated publications, in collaboration with contributing researchers. Future contributions may be incorporated as modular datasets. 
	- All major updates are versioned and archived via Zenodo.

### 2. Data Integrity
Changes affecting definitions or classification will be documented in release notes. Deprecated terms remain archived for historical transparency. Each dataset retains its own citation boundary.

### 3. Contributions
Future contributions from collaborators may be incorporated as modular datasets following data curation.
